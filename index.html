      <p><strong>I have made a few simple web pages before. Nothing too fancy, an index, a few redirect windows with links. I used css to style it and I used a few js and php scripts to add some interesting funtions.</strong></p>

      <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus the other?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>if/else should be used when testing a boolean expression vs switch statements are used to differentiate between all the different values a variable can have.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>'=' is the assignment opperator. This means you use it to tell something to be equal to another. '==' is used to test if one thing is equal to another. A slight difference but an important one.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>To generate a random number you use ‘Math.random()’. What is ‘Math’? What is the return type of the ‘.random()’ method. Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’ capitalized (you may need to investigate Static classes...hint hint).</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Math is a class just like most things in java. It has static methods(functions) that allow you to call them from anywhere in code. random is a specific funtion that is used to generate a random double between 1 and 0</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What does it mean to ‘cast a double to an int’? Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Doubles are a floating point number thus stored in form ""+1.234 x 2 ^ -5". Integers are stored as simple binary numbers. So 5.0 as a float does not have the same bit representation as "5 as an integer". Also the number of bits used to store the answer can differ. Casting allows you to transfer over the "real" value between types with possible losses of data( a risk you maky have to take) For example, if you generate a random number, it is generated as a double(with decimal points). However you may want a random integer. You would need to cast for this to be possible.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What is the difference between ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loops? Give an example of when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit of a ‘do while’ over a ‘while’?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Do while loops execute the code inside once before preforming the boolean check. This makes them useful when you want to always do something at least once. Think of a simple tic-tac-toe game: you may want program to automatically run the game once, and then after the game is over, ask if they want to play again.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Java like many langues has a number of standard libraries to call basic functions from. This is included in the java libraries that are installed on your computer.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>void simply means that the function will not return a value. Functions(methods) have the ability to return a value. This is useful for a function that takes in two numbers and adds them together. But if you are printing numbers to the command line, you do not need to return any value ergo void.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>There is a slight difference between parameter and argument, at least in the usage of the term. Argument is the values that get taken in when the method is called. Parameters are the names of these values within the scope of the method. </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What experience do you have coding? What have you created already? What do you want to create during/after the program?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>I have a pretty strong background knowledge of c++. I learned c++ when I was in high school because i had no idea where to start language wise. It took me way to long to get good at it since it is such a low level language by todays standards. But now I love it. I have created a number of games and projects with c++. I have dipped my toe into java, html, css, js, python, and sql as well but with less mastery understanding than i currently have. I am hoping to obtain a portfolio of projects in java, js, and html and continue building projects in c++.</em>

          <strong>What is your ultimate goal in attending Skill Distillery? How are you going to achieve it? What is your big 'why'?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Ultimately I want a job. I know what you are thinking: thats the wrong reason to program. But for me it is not. I love programming, and I love to learn, But I get large satisfaction when I do work and preform a service to society and myself. I Want to be able to learn on the job, not just in the classroom. But I realize with something as vast as coding, some upfront schooling must be put in. Skill distillery is the most like the ways I enjoy learning. Hard and Intense forward. I attended college for two years before this and It just seemed like i did not need to spend 4 years in a classroom watching the skills I obtained freshman year go out of date.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What pitfalls have you encountered when trying to learn new skills or accomplish your goals in the past? How are you going to avoid them this time? How are you keeping yourself accountable (who is keeping you accountable)?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>I have one main problem with learning and it has been difficult to control. Being overworked into boredom. I have never liked the pace of normal classrooms because they have a very specific limitation. They go to slow. If a topic is interesting, They do not go fast enough for me to learn all I want to learn about it. If the topic is dull they are slow rolling through it and it is a constant endurance push to stay interested. This is one of the main reasons I was so attracted to this program. The other refreshing thing is the fact that i do not need to take 8 completely different subjects at the same time. When I would do that it gave me an excuse to overlearn on the interesting topics which would cause others to slip. This program should naturally help all of these issues.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>When you get frustrated and discouraged what do you do? How can you keep your confidence up and encourage yourself during the program?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>When can get frustrated I am quite good at powering through and looking for an answer. This is do to the fact that it is hard to discorage me. I am sort of a realist/optimist. I am able to pretty quickly realize that if I physically posses the ability to complete something, then the only way I can do that is by pushing foreward.</em>
